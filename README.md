About The Dataset

Launched by the World Bank with funding from Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Financial Inclusion Database draws on the collected survey data with regards to financial inclusion that aims to understand how adults save, borrow, make payments, and manage risk. 

The survey targets 1000 adults age 15 and above in Indonesia, and includes questions on access to and use of formal and informal financial services. It has additional data on the use of financial technology (or fintech), including the use of mobile phones and the internet to conduct financial transactions.

The details on the description of each survey question can be found on http://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3361/datafile/F3.
